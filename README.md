# Confession-Web-app
Simple Confession website

This is a simple website made for writing confession and saving that confession in our database. 


For making this website we have used mongodb database for storing the data of different confessions in the form of string. 

In this app I have implemented the REST api's like GET, POST, DELETE to perform the users actions and try to make this website as dynamic as possible.

We have used Node JS and implemented the basic structure needed to build a long websites like for eg. Controllers and model, routes etc. 

I have Used the EJS file formatting for setting up the frontend of the website and responding to users query as per needed.
